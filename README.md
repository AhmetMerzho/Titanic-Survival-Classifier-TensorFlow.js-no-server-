# Titanic Survival Classifier (TensorFlow.js, no server)
# A lightweight, fully client-side web app that trains a shallow binary classifier on the Kaggle Titanic dataset using TensorFlow.js and tfjs-vis. Runs entirely in the browser (works on GitHub Pages). Upload train.csv and test.csv, train, evaluate with ROC/AUC + threshold slider, predict, and export submission.csv.
